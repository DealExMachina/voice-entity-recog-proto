# Health Check Issue Fix

## Problem Summary
The Koyeb deployment was failing because health checks were being rate limited. The logs showed:
```
Rate limit exceeded for IP: 57.129.36.253, Path: /health
```

This was causing the instance to fail health checks and shut down.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Inconsistent health check paths**: Different parts of the system were using different endpoints
2. **Rate limiting applied to health checks**: The health endpoint was getting rate limited by Koyeb's infrastructure calls

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile Health Check
**File**: `Dockerfile`
**Change**: Updated health check endpoint from `/api/health` to `/health`
```diff
- CMD curl -f http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/api/health || exit 1
+ CMD curl -f http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}/health || exit 1
```

### 2. Fixed Docker Compose Health Check  
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`
**Change**: Updated health check endpoint from `/api/health` to `/health`
```diff
- test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
+ test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
```

### 3. Applied Health-Specific Rate Limiter
**File**: `src/index.ts`
**Change**: Applied the `healthLimiter` middleware which has skip logic for health checks
```diff
- app.get('/health', (req: Request, res: Response): void => {
+ app.get('/health', healthLimiter, (req: Request, res: Response): void => {
```

The `healthLimiter` includes logic to skip rate limiting for:
- Health check paths (`/health`, `/api/health`)
- Koyeb infrastructure IPs (including `57.129.*` pattern)
- Internal/private IPs

## Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build:production`
- ✅ Health endpoint uses proper rate limiting exclusions
- ✅ All health check configurations now use consistent `/health` endpoint

## Deployment
To deploy the fix:

### Option 1: Manual Koyeb Dashboard Deploy
1. Go to [Koyeb Dashboard](https://app.koyeb.com)
2. Update your existing service or create new one
3. Use repository: `DealExMachina/voice-entity-recog-proto`
4. **Important**: Set health check path to `/health` (not `/api/health`)
5. Environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=3000` 
   - `AI_PROVIDER=demo`
   - `DB_PATH=/tmp/entities.db`
   - `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true`

### Option 2: CLI Deploy (if you have Koyeb token)
```bash
export KOYEB_TOKEN=your_token_here
./deploy-demo.sh
```

## Expected Result
With these fixes, the health checks should now pass successfully because:
1. Koyeb will check the correct `/health` endpoint
2. The `healthLimiter` will skip rate limiting for Koyeb's IP (`57.129.36.253`)
3. Health checks will return proper status without being blocked

The deployment should now start successfully and remain running.
